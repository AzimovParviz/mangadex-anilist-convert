# Starting
Either **npm install** then **npm start**

## OR

Use docker compose **docker compose up**

# Usage
Login through the AniList to authorize this application

##Note

Right now only works locally because I set the allowed redirect only to localhost, in the future it will be hosted on GitHub pages or alternatives

After that, login to mangadex with your credentials (Mangadex developers are working on implementing OAuth2, will be added here as soon as possible)

Click the **Get follows** button after successfully logging in

If you are ready, click the **Upload your AniList with Mangadex entries** button. Right now the only indication of progress is in the browser console but visual indication is in the plans
